# 2025-02-07 — Telegram Pairing Issue & Resolution

## Problem
Telegram bot (@rasandeclawbot) was showing "not authorized" error. Messages were being received but not processed.

## Root Cause
Telegram channel was configured and running, but the user's Telegram account (ID: 7964555583) was not paired/approved to receive responses from the bot.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Verify gateway status
```bash
systemctl --user status openclaw-gateway
```

### 2. Check logs for Telegram activity
```bash
tail -50 /tmp/openclaw/openclaw-2026-02-07.log | grep -i telegram
```

### 3. Pair the user
```bash
openclaw pairing approve telegram 34LY9N57
```

### Output
```
Approved telegram sender 7964555583.
```

## Key Configuration Files
- **Gateway service**: `~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service`
- **Environment vars**: `~/.openclaw/.env`
- **Telegram config**: `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (channels.telegram.botToken)

## Important Notes
- Telegram bot token stored in `.env` as `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
- Gateway reads `.env` via `EnvironmentFile=` in systemd service
- Pairing code required: `openclaw pairing approve telegram <code>`
- Message channel logs show `messageChannel=telegram` when working
